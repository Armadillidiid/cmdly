### suggest

Generate command suggestions from natural language descriptions.

**Usage:**

```bash
cmdly suggest [prompt] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `prompt` (optional) - Natural language description of what you want to do. If omitted, you'll be prompted interactively.

**Options:**

- `-t, --target <type>` - Target command type: `shell` (default) or `git`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive mode
cmdly suggest

# Direct prompt
cmdly suggest "list all processes using port 3000"

# Direct prompt with target
cmdly suggest "show diff for the last merge commit" --target git
```

**Interactive Actions:**

After receiving a suggestion, you can:

- **Run** - Execute the command immediately
- **Revise** - Refine the suggestion with additional context
- **Explain** - Get a detailed breakdown of how the command works
- **Copy** - Copy the command to your clipboard
